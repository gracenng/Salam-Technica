## Intro
Our website, Salam, meaning peace in Arabic, was created to provide consumers and investors the ability to determine the ethical nature of the companies that they invest and support through purchases.
## Backend
We gather our data for organizations through public 990 tax forms from the IRS, processes and categorizes the information to make it more accessible.
The website presents the data collected through a packed circle chart, and a short summary describing the most recent actions of the company.
## Target Demographic
While the primary user base is a general consumer, we also wanted to consider the potential business impact of tracking and presenting this information publicly. Investors are able to analyze stocks of the company and decide if they agree with the public stance presented, as well as an email alerter where they can subscribe to any updates for interesting companies. 

Finally, we also provide resources and blog posts to allow the community to discuss and seek further understanding about issues and share their own experiences with companies.
